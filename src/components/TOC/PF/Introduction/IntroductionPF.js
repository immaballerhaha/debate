                <h1>Public Forum Debate</h1>
                <p>Public Forum debate is more focused with policy rather than philosophical questions of morality.  In PF, teams of two debaters each will either affirm or negate a resolution that gets updated once every month.  </p>

                <h3>PF is a Debate about Policy</h3>
                <p>In PF, there is no framework (usually).  It is automatically assumed that the round will be weighed on a scale of net benefits.  This means whichever debate team can prove the greater material benefit (purely from a policy perspective) wins the debate.  As such, rounds are a bit shorter and speech times are between 2 to 4 minutes each.</p>
                <p>Since PF is a partner debate, you ideally should find someone who you are compatible with.  Winning rounds requires both debaters to be in sync, trust each other, and delegate responsibilities.  You wonâ€™t really have much time to discuss between yourselves during a round, so both debaters need to be able to independently execute their roles.  Furthermore, delegating who is responsible for doing research in particular areas and dividing up work is also a big part of it.  If you work well with others, PF is perfect for you! </p>
                <p>As a side note, PF is also a great way for novices to learn quickly through firsthand experience as partners to more skilled debaters.  This of course, relies on a skilled debater being present and also willing to take on an apprentice.  </p>
                <p>Here are a few examples of common PF topics</p>
