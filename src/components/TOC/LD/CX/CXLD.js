                <h1>Cross-Examination</h1>
                <p>With really lay judges, it’s honestly all won or lost in cross-ex.  For one, it’s the most interesting aspect of the debate so they pay the most attention.  It’s also a place where you can clearly display who is the dominant debater.  Ask a couple hard questions that your opponent can’t answer and they’ve lost almost all credibility in the eyes of the judge. </p>

                <p>Make no mistake, in round ethos is extremely important even though it can’t be quantified.  The more ethos you display, the more likely a judge is to buy your arguments.  The judge might not necessarily understand all your arguments, but if they trust you, they trust that you’re probably right.<br/><br/>So how do you handle cross-examination so that you always come out on top and win major ethos points?</p>

                    <AccordionItem title='Question Evidence/Methodology'>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>I like to spend the majority of my time in CX asking questions about the opposition’s evidence.  It’s a major hit against the opposition’s credibility if its shown clearly in CX that they either don’t understand their own evidence or if the evidence has serious flaws.  It’s also much easier to prove that a piece of evidence is outright wrong rather than an entire argument, and doing so is more memorable as well.  For example, the judge is going to remember the time you understood your opponent’s evidence even better than he did and disproved it, which means in the next rebuttal speech all you have to do is say “this piece of evidence is seriously flawed as I pointed out in cross-ex.” </p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>This is a super efficient use of time because generally, if you point out a logical flaw on a contention in CX, you’re going to need to repeat that logic again in your rebuttal speech for the judge to flow and remember it (wasting CX time, you could have just pointed out the flaw during rebuttal and it would be the same).  The takeaway is, it’s much easier for a judge to remember that certain pieces of evidence have been disproved, rather than remember the exact logical flaw in a contention.</p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>To effectively call into question the validity of evidence, you need to fully understand the key components of evidence methodology (full rundown is in the “Research” tab under “Advanced Topics: Strategic Evidence” and “Understanding Methodology”).  Questioning evidence effectively involves asking questions about the sample size, sample scope, year of study, years of study, assumptions made, margin of error, and data collection methodology.</p>
                    </AccordionItem>
                    <AccordionItem title='Question Evidence/Methodology: Examples'>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>Example: “What is the sample size of this study?  Only 30 participants?  How is that representative of the U.S. population?”</p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>Example: “Is your study based in the U.S.? No? What part of Iceland’s economy and political system is even remotely close to ours?”</p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>Example: “Your study on disease only spans 2 week?  How do we know the participants didn’t just start experiencing symptoms after a month?”</p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>Example: “When was your study conducted?  In the 1990s?  Why do you think that study is more accurate than the one I have from just a year ago?”</p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>Notice the patterns in the above examples.  It should be leading question, leading question, boom final rhetorical question/remark that is kind of sarcastic (but not overboard) and makes your opponent look dumb.</p>
                    </AccordionItem>
                    <AccordionItem title='Question Framework'>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>Some debaters are tricky and you want to avoid framework traps.  Don’t just outright ask “what does your framework mean though” because your opponent is going to blab on and on without answering anything.  You want to come out and say “if I prove X in this round does that mean Y under your framework?”</p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>Don’t just assume you have the same framework as your opponent.  Even if they sound similar be 100% sure and ask “Both of our values and value criterions seem similar, does that mean whoever proves X in the round wins?”</p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>To attack frameworks, I find it most useful to use a specific example where that framework is wrong.  You can try to dismantle the internal logic but that could get super confusing for the judge and a good opponent will just abstract it all away with broad vague generalizations that get you nowhere.  So give a specific scenario “If X happens, under your framework wouldn’t we do Y? And isn’t Y horrible?”</p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>Sometimes (oftentimes), your opponent’s contentions will actually violate their own framework in some way.  The common one that immediately pops up, is when the framework is freedom, and then they say the government should force people to do something.  Or when the framework is democracy and it turns out the majority don’t support their action.  You should point it out when that happens.</p>
                    </AccordionItem>
                    <AccordionItem title='Questioning Framework: Examples'>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>Example: “Under util, if we only care about the consequences, wouldn’t that justify things like slavery if it benefits the economy?  I don’t care if it actually does or not, but wasn’t the mindset of slavery, that people could be sacrificed for a greater good?”</p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>Example: “Under you framework, we wouldn’t be able to save one hundred people if it meant killing one.  Why is the life of one person more valuable than a hundred if humans are inherently all equal.”</p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>Example: “If we derive morality from only following the constitution, does that mean the ⅗ compromise was moral?  I don’t care if it evolves and improves through time, the danger is that, if today the constitution says that women shouldn’t be allowed to vote, should we follow it?”</p>
                    </AccordionItem>
                    <AccordionItem title='Question Internal Logic Flaws'>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>Contentions that are outright silly or can be easily disproved should targeted next.  The best way to prove an argument false is through an empirical, real world example.  “If X is true doesn’t that imply Y?  Then why doesn’t Y happen?” </p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}><strong>Example: </strong>“If it’s true that a gun ban will lead to a black market, why haven’t we seen that in Sweden where gun crime is now at an all time low?  I don’t care that it’s not the U.S., if your warrant is true, people will still want to get illegal guns regardless of their nationality right?”</p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>You can also prove an argument false by countering bad logic with good logic.  This is just the classic “you’re wrong, let me explain why” but in question form.</p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}><strong>Example: </strong>“You say that a universal basic income is bad because people will use government money to buy drugs and alcohol.  By this logic, why does the government give poor people money at all?”</p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}><strong>Example: </strong>“You say that poor people are lazy and don’t work so they don’t deserve basic income.  Are you just condemning all the lazy people to die then?”</p>
                    </AccordionItem>
                    <AccordionItem title='Pitch Rebuttals'>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>Another strategy during CX is to pitch potential rebuttals you were thinking about making in the next speech.  This way, you can feel out how prepared your opponent is to deal with certain types of rebuttals.  After you read a rebuttal phrased as a question, if your opponent doesn’t know how to answer, it’s a sign they aren’t prepared to handle it.  Conversely, if your opponent confidently responds with an answer, you should find a good way to cut them off, and remember not to read that response during the rebuttal speech. </p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}><strong>Example: </strong>“For your third contention, isn’t it true that given the current state of U.S. politics, passing such a policy would massively polarize congress?”</p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}><strong>Example: </strong>“In your second contention, you say that companies will shift to green technology but doesn’t it make more sense for them to shift to natural gas since it’s more economical?”</p>
                    </AccordionItem>
                    <AccordionItem title='Politely Cutting Them Off'>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>A lot of time, your opponent is going to ramble to try and waste time.  When this happens, you need to be able to effectively cut them off and ask your next question without seeming rude.  To do so, first acknowledge that you have listened to the opponent in some way, then ask your question.  Use phrases like “thank you, I would like to ask my next question now” “I understand,” “please wait a second,” and “I would like to move on to a more important question” to transition the opponent out of his monologue.</p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>My favorite technique by far though to combat blabbing opponents, is to pretend like I want to build off something they are saying, but then just ask another question entirely.  No one catches on if you do it subtly.  It usually looks something like, “Wait… what you just said was really interesting, so let me ask you this [insert next question].”  If your opponent ever asks what that question has to do with what they were saying just say “you’re about to find out.”  But of course they will never find out :(.</p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>If none of the above works, you need to just say “Hey, I don’t mean to be rude, but it is my cross-examination and I have many more questions that I would like to get a chance to ask.”  That’s the trump that you don’t want to use unless you have to though.</p>

                <h2>When You're Beat</h2>
                <p>Sometimes you’re going to get a question you don’t know the answer too.  The important thing is to maintain confidence because the last thing you want to do is appear lost to the judge.  Now, there are a couple tactics that you can use when you’ve got a tough question you don’t know the answer to.</p>
                <Accordion> 
                    <AccordionItem title='Play Dumb'>
                        <img src='https://gunaxin.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/PatrickStar.jpg' alt='patrick-star' height='20%' width='20%' align='left' style={{padding : '1rem 1rem 1rem 2rem', }}/>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>In the play dumb strategy, you don’t want to appear dumb of course, but you want to feign enough incompetence to convince your opponent it’s not worth it.  If you can draw out one question past 30 seconds, you’ve done your part and a good debater will ditch it and move on.</p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>Playing dumb is a form of cluelessness.  You want to ask questions like “what do you mean?” without saying those exact words.  Ask your opponent to define certain words in his question (‘what is the exact level of poverty we are talking about here?”).  Then when he defines it there will probably be even more terms: ask him to define those as well (“But what exactly does the bottom 15% entail?”).  You can also say “it depends” and that there needs to be more context for you to answer that question (“it depends, there needs to be more context for me to give a definitive answer”).  Then start asking him to define terms in his “context.”</p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>If those two examples don’t apply, you can just repeat the contention in question.  But do it like this.  “I don’t understand what you’re so confused about.  It clearly states in my contention that [repeat your contention].”  Your opponent is likely going to say that doesn’t answer his question (because it probably won’t), at which time you will say “Yes it does, pay attention, I’ll explain it again [recite contention again].”  Repeat as many time as necessary and don’t laugh when you do it -keep a straight face.</p>
                    </AccordionItem>
                    <AccordionItem title='Offer a Different Interpretation'>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>If you don’t have the answer to a specific question your opponent asks, you can think of a similar question that you do know the answer to.  First, you must rephrase your opponent’s question into the one you know the answer to.  It’ll look something like “What I think you are asking is [insert similar question].  The answer is …”  If your opponent doesn’t get sidetracked by the new question/answer and corrects you, you should think about it for a second, then provide alter his question a little again into something that you do have the answer to.  “Oh, I’m sorry, so you actually meant to ask [insert another similar question] well the answer to that is…” Rinse and repeat.</p>

                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>If you don’t want to answer a question, you answer a question with another question.  This will look something like “Why does it matter?,” “Does this question have any relevance to the resolution?,” or “Why did you specifically mention X in your question?.”  Your opponent is likely not going to be amused and isn’t going to humor you with an explanation.  Likely, the response will be “just answer the question,” at which point you should hold your ground and force a deadlock by saying, “no I believe it’s important to know before I answer your question.  Why are you avoiding my question?”</p>

                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>If you don’t want to answer a question, you can also procrastinate and postpone it for later.  But you need to provide a good reason why, just like you would make up a good excuse to your college professor if you wanted an extension.  This will usually look something like “The answer to that question is extremely complicated and requires additional evidence which I will provide in my next speech.  Therefore please be patient, and your question will be addressed in my rebuttal.”  Spoiler alert: it won’t.</p>

                <p>As you probably have gathered, none of these solutions are really ideal -at most it’s putting band aid on the wound.  There’s a chance they become a time winning move if your opponent is incompetent, but they will never be an argument winning move.  Also, you start to look a lot like those politicians who skirt around questions to avoid looking bad, which is not a good association.  You want to avoid these situations as much as possible and you can do so my having done good research on both the topic and your own case arguments prior to the tournament!</p>
                <h2>Don’t Get Pinned by Yes/No’s</h2>
                <p>Okay as a general rule, anytime you get asked to respond to a question with only a yes/no, do not respond with yes or no.  Even if your opponent forces you, just say, “The issue is a lot more complicated that a simple yes or no.  Please let me explain” or “A simple yes or no greatly oversimplifies a very complex issue.  I can explain quickly.”  If you’re opponent is being really pushy about it you can afford to be a little passive aggressive (“Do you think every question can be answered with just a simple yes/no?”).</p>
                <h2>Handling No Warrant Arguments Optimally:</h2>
                <p>A lot of times you are going to notice that a contention or claim is missing a warrant.  Many debaters would feel compelled then, to ask for the warrant during cross examination.  This is an intuitive reaction, but not the most optimal one.  You are, in essence, giving your opponent a chance to provide a warrant during your CX time -it’s basically like giving your opponent more time for their constructive since they get to freely elaborate and strengthen a particular point.  What you want to do instead is point out in your rebuttal speech that a warrant is missing and until it is provided, the argument should be assumed false.  This forces your opponent to use his speech time to provide new evidence (if he even has it).</p>
                <p>A bad situation you don’t want to work yourself into is one where you ask your opponent if they have evidence to back up a claim and they either say yes and read it right then and there during your CX or, say yes, and that you can look at it now or during prep time.  If the first outcome happens you just let your opponent use your CX time as their constructive time, and if the second outcome happens, you now have to use your own prep time to see their evidence.  You can no longer claim in the next speech that they have no warrant because they already offered for you to look at it during prep but you didn’t take them up on it.  Sure the argument might still stand, but your perceptual dominance takes a hit.</p>
                <h2>Asking for Evidence</h2>
                <p>Always always ask to see evidence after your CX.  You will not believe how many debaters don’t know what they’re evidence is actually saying, don’t have the evidence to give you, or are just flat out lying.  Pointing out flaws in their card is an easy way to take out an argument and really strengthens your perceptual dominance (shows that you know what you’re talking about and your opponent doesn’t).</p>
                <p>During CX, you will usually identify a few pieces of sketchy evidence that don’t add up.  As CX concludes, you should politely ask to see those cards, and note that you will start the timer for your 4 minutes of prep AFTER you are given the cards.  It is key that you start the timer after getting the evidence, so that you don’t get punished if your opponent is simply incompetent and takes a long time to find their card.</p>
                <p>When you receive the evidence, first check to make sure the methodology, claims, and warrants your opponent states are all true and show up in the card.  If it doesn’t, they’ve given you the wrong card and you should stop the timer and politely ask them for the right card.  Once you have it, look for qualifying statements and read the small text carefully.  Usually when an author makes an outrageous statement, it will usually be qualified with another more realistic statement.</p>
                <p><strong>Example: </strong>“Passing right to housing policies has the potential to completely eradicate homelessness [...] if banks cooperated and sold off their property holdings at below market value.”</p>
                <p>As you can see in the above example, your opponent probably only highlighted the first half.  It is your responsibility to read the small text (second half) and point out that in no plausible world would banks take a hit and sell off all their property holdings for nothing.</p>

                <p>There are going to be rounds where you’re confused over some of your opponent’s arguments.  Although your initial impulse is to clarify in CX, please control that instinct and evaluate the situation a little more carefully.</p>
                <Accordion>
                    <AccordionItem title='Situation 1: You + Judge Both Confused'>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>Why are you confused -is your opponent intentionally making the argument confusing for you?  A common strategy used among debaters is to have one argument in their case that is intentionally vague and confusing meant to be used as a time suck.  They have no intention of going for the argument in their last speech but will enjoy watching you waste time trying to make sense of it in yours.  In this scenario, however, recognize that the judge is just as confused and just as unlikely to vote on it as you are.</p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>What you don’t want to do is force the opponent to clarify this argument in your CX just so you can rebut it in the next speech.  That’s the same as giving your CX time to your opponent as constructive time.  What you want to do instead, is ask more important questions during your CX, and then push the “confusing” argument over the brink into oblivion in the next rebuttal speech.</p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>This strategy has already been explained in the “Rebuttals” tab under “Scoring the Flow : 2,” but basically you should fight fire with fire and reply with an equally convoluted, vague, and confusing rebuttal.  I’m not telling you to say something stupid or obviously wrong.  Ideally, you say something that makes your opponent’s contention even more nonsensical.</p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>The key is to ignore the flow and understand that the judge is currently already very skeptical about the contention in question.  Push his skepticism over the edge into the abyss by responding with an equally vague and confusing rebuttal, and the judge’s brain will short circuit making them very hesitant to even consider that contention while voting.  You know how in school sometimes a problem gets so confusing you think to yourself “I don’t even want to think about this anymore?”  That’s the state of mind you want to cast the judge into.</p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}><strong>Takeaway: </strong>Don’t clarify things that everyone is confused about in CX unless you know you can turn it in your favor</p>
                    </AccordionItem>
                    <AccordionItem title='Situation 1: Example'>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}><strong>Opponent: </strong>“Contention 1.  The government should invest in ionospheric ionization technology.  These towers change the electron density within clouds and allows for 10x more rainfall.  This is the key to boosting agriculture and avoiding water wars.”</p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>Okay.  So you obviously have no idea what ionospheric ionization is and your opponent didn’t bother explaining which means it’s probably a time suck argument and both you and your judge are confused.  Don’t ask any questions about it in CX; in fact, pretend you know exactly what your opponent is talking about.</p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>Okay, now it’s prep time.  You don’t know what ionospheric ionization is but you do know what an electron is.  You also know (hopefully) that manipulating electrons can cause atoms to become unstable and radioactive.  And you also know that radioactive stuff is “bad” and can cause cancer and stuff.</p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>Okay, what else do you know.  You can surmise that if it’s actually true that this technology exists every country would be using it right now or investing big dollars into it.  Why haven’t you heard of it?  It’s probably safe to assume there’s still lots of uncertainty regarding this technology -you can use that.</p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}><strong>Your Response: </strong>"2 responses on my opponents first contention about ionospheric ionization.  First, TURN this argument because manipulating large scales of electrons can potentially lead to regions of dense radioactivity, leading to increased risk of cancer and disease.  Second, ionospheric technology is still vastly understudied.  Electron manipulation can catalyze chemical chain reactions that devastate the environment in the future.  Scientists still question its long term applications, which is why the government isn’t currently funding it.”</p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>See how we made seemingly solid rebuttals without even fully grasping what the opponent’s argument was?  This is not a formula but rather a thought processing pattern you should use whenever you approach intentionally confusing arguments.  Pick a few words or phrases you do understand.  Make a few assumptions.  Then with your new (somewhat distorted) image of what the opponent is saying, craft a rebuttal that is vague, confusing, but not necessarily untrue.</p>

                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>This situation is a lot tougher because it just means you either lack experience or just zoned out for a minute.  In this case, if it’s clear the judge understands the argument and only you don’t, it would be extremely dangerous not to ask about it in CX (what if it was an independent voter?).  Depending on how confused you are, your questions will have to range from “What exactly do you mean by X?” to “What was your first contention saying again?”</p>
                        <p style={{padding : '1rem'}}>Good news though, you can avoid most of these situations by doing rigorous topic research before the round and listening actively during!</p>
